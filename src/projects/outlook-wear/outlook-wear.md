        Outlook Wear

    <p class="project-description">
        I was the designer on a complete redesign of the Outlook app on Google's Wear OS. I worked on the redesign while collaborating with contacts at Samsung to make sure that the experience excelled on their new Galaxy Watches, a result of a cross-company partnership with us at Microsoft. 
        <br/><br/>
        From a bespoke Outlook watch face to the design of the main Mail and Calendar modules, I redesigned everything from the ground up with my awesome partners in PM and Dev. Notably Curtis, Mitali and Andy. This took a lot of design inspiration from the Apple Watch app
