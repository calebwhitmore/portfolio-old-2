        A homage to some of my favourite products.
    </h4>
    <p class="project-description">
        I've built a huge appreciation for good design over the years. Documentaries like Objectified and Abstract have played a huge role in helping spread design awareness and appreciation. While I can't hope to produce something to the scale of those projects, this is my own small little tribute to products I appreciate. 
        <br/><br/>
        Using illustrator, I've tried to distill each objects form down into a style that's bold, simple, and captures each object by their core visual elements. With objects ranging from Aesop handwash to the Porsche 911.

        I auctioned off a calendar that included the icons for the Microsoft Give auction, which is a yearly event that raises money for charity. Stickers are also in the works.
