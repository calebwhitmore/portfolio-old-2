            It's important to stay inspired. For design I do so by looking at the work happening around me, and through visiting resources and sites that I naturally discover across the industry. I get excited when I see someone who's perfected their craft, because it gives me a new challenge, a new learning opportunity, and a new goal to aspire towards. 
            <br/> <br/> 
            I've collected this list for two reasons. For myself as a reminder to revisit these sites, but also to share with you. Maybe you're looking for inspiration - or (more likely) you're a recruiter looking for candidates. And if I don't seem like a good fit for your team, here's a list of other talented designers for you to reach out to.
