        <h4>
          Born in '93, I grew up in Hampshire. In 2016 I graduated with a degree
          in Product design which taught me a lot about the design process.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          I love learning, and owning as much process as I can - from user
          research to pixel pushing, and even a little bit of front end
          development. Right now, I'm working on Outlook - one of the biggest
          mail clients in the world. My day to day involves a lot of things,
          from initial research and strategy all the way through to final UI
          proposals and UI Kit development & maintenance.
        </h4>
        <h4>
          I've been in the industry for 5 years, and possess a diverse skillset
          spanning both digital and physical. I like to work on meaningful
          products and live for a good design system.

        <h4>
          Outside of work you can find me cycling, playing pick up basketball,
          or tinkering with a new hobby (3d printing is the latest one).
